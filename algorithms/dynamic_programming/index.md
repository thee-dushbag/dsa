# Dynamic Programming.

Dynamic programming is usefulwhen you're trying to optimize something given a constraint.

You can use dynamic when the problem can be broken into discrete subproblems and they don't depend on each other.

## DP Tips.

1. Every DP solution involves a grid.
1. The values in the cells are usually what you're trying to optimize.
1. Each cell is a subproblem.

## The Grid.

To make the grid needed when solving a problem using DP, you need to answer these three questions.

1. What are the values of the cells.
1. How do you divide the problem into subproblems.
1. What are the axes of the grid.
